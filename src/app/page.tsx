          <h1>Easy Snippets App: User Data Privacy Policy</h1>

          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>This Privacy Policy reflects our commitment to the privacy and protection of user data within the "Easy
                Snippets" app. "Easy Snippets" is an application designed to improve your productivity by allowing you
                to save and organize code snippets directly on your device. We prioritize user privacy above all,
                ensuring that all user data is stored locally on your computer or browser without any data collection,
                storage, or transmission to external servers.</p>

          <h2>Data Collection and Use</h2>
          <p><strong>Local Storage Only</strong>: "Easy Snippets" does not collect, store, or transmit any personal,
                sensitive, or browsing data to external servers. All data is stored locally on the user's device,
                ensuring complete privacy and control over their information.</p>
          <p><strong>Application Functionality</strong>: The app leverages local storage to save user preferences and
                code snippets. This process is entirely local, with no external data interactions or dependencies.</p>
          <p><strong>Consent and Control</strong>: Given the local storage approach, user consent for data handling is
                not required beyond standard application permissions. Users maintain full control over their data, with
                the ability to modify or delete their stored snippets at any time.</p>

          <h2>Secure Data Handling</h2>
          <p><strong>Local Data Security</strong>: While "Easy Snippets" primarily operates with local data storage, we
                advocate for and encourage users to maintain their device's security to protect their locally stored
                data.</p>
          <p><strong>Privacy by Design</strong>: Our app is designed with privacy as a core principle, ensuring that
                user data remains on the user's device without any external access or transmission.</p>

          <h2>Privacy Policy Compliance</h2>
          <p><strong>Compliance with App Store Policies</strong>: This Privacy Policy adheres to the policies of the
                respective app stores regarding personal or sensitive user data, emphasizing our commitment to data
                privacy.</p>
          <p><strong>Transparency and User Control</strong>: We are transparent about our data handling practicesâ€”since
                we do not collect data, our policy centers on user control and local data management.</p>
          <p><strong>Commitment to Privacy</strong>: Our dedication to user privacy is unwavering. "Easy Snippets" has
                been crafted to respect user privacy fully, with a strict local storage policy for all user data.</p>

          <h2>User Rights and Choices</h2>
          <p><strong>User Control and Data Management</strong>: Users have absolute control over their data within "Easy
                Snippets," including the ability to edit, delete, or backup their snippets as needed.</p>
          <p><strong>Offline Functionality</strong>: Given the app's reliance on local storage, "Easy Snippets" is
                inherently functional both online and offline, without any compromise to privacy or functionality.</p>

          <h2>Modifications to the Policy</h2>
          <p><strong>Policy Updates</strong>: We will continue to uphold our privacy commitments in any future updates
                to this policy, ensuring they are communicated clearly to our users.</p>

          <p>We are dedicated to safeguarding your digital privacy and security. If you have any questions regarding
                this policy or the "Easy Snippets" app, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
